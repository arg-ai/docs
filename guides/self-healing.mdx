## Add `max_attempts`

When the LLM hallucinates we can make it self heal/repair. You just add `max_attempts` as a argument to the function and it will be attempting to fix itself till `max_attempts` is reached or a successfull call is made:

```python
arg(
    "Create a file called language.csv with the top 10 most popular programming languages available, after that show me only the low complexity languages.", 
    max_calls=10,
    max_attempts=5
)
```

<Info>
  The results of a function won't be appended until `max_attempts` or answer is reached to save tokens + context limit.
