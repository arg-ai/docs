## Add `max_calls`
Sometimes a query will require functions being called not once but multiple times consecutively. This will be able choose and run different registered functions till `max_calls` or an answer is reached.

```python
arg(
    """1. Write a file called "hello.txt" that says "hello world".
2. Then write a file called "bye.txt" that says "bye world".
3. Then say "hello!"`""",
    max_calls=10,
    max_attempts=5
)
```

logs:
```
1: 💬: 1. Write a file called "hello.txt" that says "hello world".
2. Then write a file called "bye.txt" that says "bye world".
3. Then say "hello!"
