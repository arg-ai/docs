Sometimes a query will require functions being called not once but multiple times consecutively. This will be able choose and run different registered functions till `max_calls` or an answer is reached.

```python
arg(
    "Create a file called language.csv with the top 10 most popular programming languages available, after that show me only the low complexity languages.", 
    max_calls=10,
)
```
