## Choosing the model
We currently only support OpenAI but more is coming soon.

```python
arg = ArgAI(model="openai/gpt-3.5-turbo-0613")
```

## Adjust the function
Below is a pretty basic function. By default argai will automatically try generating the necessary descriptions for the llm, however you can adjust it to get better performance if you manually describe the function in detail.
```python
def my_function(text):
    return {"okay"}
```

### Adjusting the description
You can add a description to your function by adding a docstring
```python
def my_function():
    """My function does this"""
    return {"okay"}
```

Input descriptions:
```python
```

### Adjusting the output
```
```
