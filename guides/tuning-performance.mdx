## Choosing the model
We currently only support OpenAI but more is coming soon.

```python
arg = ArgAI(model="openai/gpt-3.5-turbo-0613")
```

## Providing a system prompt
`arg` can accept more than just strings but full conversations. This allows you to add a system prompt which can improve accuracy.
```python
arg([
    {
        "role": "system",
        "content": "..."
    },
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "..."
    }
])
```

## Adjust the function definition
Below is a pretty basic function. By default argai will automatically try generating the necessary descriptions for the llm, however you can adjust it to get better performance if you manually describe the function in detail.
```python
def create_file(filename, text):
    with open(filename,'w') as f:
        f.write(text)
        return {"success":True}
```

### Adjust the function description
You can add a description to your function by adding a docstring
```python
def create_file(filename, text):
    """This function will create a file given the content of the file"""
    with open(filename,'w') as f:
        f.write(text)
        return {"success":True}
```

### Adjust the function input parameters
Parameter typing:
```python
def create_file(filename:str, text:str):
    """This function will create a file given the content of the file"""
    with open(filename,'w') as f:
        f.write(text)
        return {"success":True}
```

Parameter descriptions:
```python
```

### Adjust the function output
Make the output of your function more interpretable.
```python
def create_file(filename:str, text:str):
    """This function will create a file given the content of the file"""
    with open(filename,'w') as f:
        f.write(text)
        return "Successfully create the file"
```

You can separate the output for LLM vs actual output. You do this by returning your output in a dictionary with the key `_argai` this will actually make sure that the llm reads the `_argai` output instead of the actual function output.
```python
def create_file(filename:str, text:str):
    """This function will create a file given the content of the file"""
    with open(filename,'w') as f:
        f.write(text)
        return {
            "_argai" : "Successfully create the file",
            "success": True
        }
```

## Adjusting the definition with pydantic

```python
from argai import ArgAI
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

arg = ArgAI()

class CreateFileModel(BaseModel):
    """This function will create a file given the content of the file"""
    filename: str = Field(..., description="The name of the file")
    text: str = Field(..., description="The text content of the file")

@arg.register(base_model=CreateFileModel)
def create_file(filename:str, text:str):
    with open(filename,'w') as f:
        f.write(text)
        return {"success": True}
```

## Adjusting via jsonschema/openai jsonschema

If you input a jsonschema it will automatically input into the appropriate openai jsonschema
```python
from argai import ArgAI
from pydantic import BasedModel, Field

arg = ArgAI()

func_schema = {
  "parameters": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "filename": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "The name of the file to be created."
      },
      "text": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "The text content to be written to the file."
      }
    }
  },
  "name": "create_file",
  "description": "This function takes two parameters: `filename` (the name of a file to be created) and `text` (the content that will be written into the file). \n\nThe function then opens the specified file in write mode, writes the provided text into the file, and closes it. It returns a dictionary with two key-value pairs: `\"status\"` which is set to `\"success\"`, and `\"filename\"` which is set to the name of the file that was created.\n\nThis function is useful when you want to create a new file and write some specific text into it. It can be used in various scenarios, such as generating reports, creating configuration files, or creating logs with specific content."
}

@arg.register(jsonschema=func_schema)
def create_file(filename:str, text:str):
    with open(filename,'w') as f:
        f.write(text)
        return {"success": True}
```
