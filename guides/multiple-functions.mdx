Calling from multiple functions with just natural language, the LLM will automatically decide which functions to use and in which order.

## 1. First register the functions
```python
from argai import ArgAI
arg = ArgAI()

@arg.register
def create_file(filename, text):
    """Create a file from raw text"""
    with open(filename,'w') as f:
        f.write(text)
        return {"success":True}

import pandas as pd

@arg.register
def pandas_query(csv_file, query):
    """Run a pandas query on a csv file"""
    df = pd.read_csv(csv_file)
    return df.query(query)
```

## 2. Run
For complex queries that requires multiple calls of different functions set `max_calls` for consecutive calling and `max_attempts` for self-healing.
```python
arg(
    "Create a file called language.csv with the top 10 most popular programming languages available.",
    max_calls=10,
    max_attempts=5
)
```
