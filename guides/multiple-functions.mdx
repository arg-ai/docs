Calling from multiple functions with just natural language, the LLM will automatically decide which functions to use and in which order.

## 1. First register the functions
```python
import os
from argai import ArgAI
arg = ArgAI()

@arg.register
def create_file(filename, text):
    with open(filename,'w') as f:
        f.write(text)
        return {"success":True}

@arg.register
def rename_file(filename, new_filename):
    os.rename(filename, new_filename)
    return {"success":True}
```

## 2. Run
For complex queries that requires multiple calls of different functions set `max_calls` for [consecutive calling](consecutive-calls) and `max_attempts` for [self-healing](self-healing).
```python
arg("Create a file called hello.txt and then rename it to test.txt.",
    max_calls=10,
    max_attempts=5
)
```

Logs to keep track of the progress:
```
1: 💬: create a file called hello.txt and then rename it to test.txt.
    📝 Calling LLM
    🏃 Running function: create_file(filename='hello.txt', text='This is a test file.')
    ✔️ Sucessfull, result: {'success': True}
2: 🌟: Ran create_file, result: {'success': True}
    📝 Calling LLM
    🏃 Running function: rename_file(filename='hello.txt', new_filename='test.txt')
    ✔️ Sucessfull, result: {'success': True}
3: 🌟: Ran rename_file, result: {'success': True}
    📝 Calling LLM
4: 🤖: The file "hello.txt" has been successfully created and renamed to "test.txt".
