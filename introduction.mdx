description: "⚡ Run any of your functions with just natural language."

This library aims to help you develop function calling capabilities for your functions and build applications that utilizes function calling.

## What is function calling?
LLM function calling is the ability to describe functions to LLMs and have the LLMs infer the input of the functions based off natural language query. 

For example:
- “Email Anya to see if she wants to get coffee next Friday” ->
```python
send_email(to="anya@gmail.com", body="Hey Anya, do you want to get coffee this Friday? Let me know what time works best for you" )
```
- “Who are our highest spending customers” ->
```python
sql_query(query="SELECT customer, spend FROM CUSTOMERS ORDERED BY spend DESC;")
```


## Quick start
1. Install with `pip install argai`.

2. Setup your LLM. In this example we use OpenAI

via terminal:
```
export OPENAI_API_KEY="..."
```

via python:
```python
import openai
openai.api_key = "..."
```


3. Make your functions intelligent and queryable via natural language:
```python
def create_file(filename, text):
    with open(filename,'w') as f:
        f.write(text)
        return {"status" : "success", "filename" : filename}

from argai import ArgFunction

arg = ArgFunction(create_file)

result = arg("Create a file called language.csv with all the programming languages available.")
```

Logs to keep track of the progress:
```
1: 💬: Create a file called language.csv for the top 10 most popular programming languages and its complexity.
    📝 Calling LLM
    🏃 Running function: create_file(filename='language.csv', text='Language,Complexity\nPython,Low\nJavaScript,Medium\nJava,High\nC++,High\nC#,Medium\nRuby,Low\nPHP,Medium\nSwift,Medium\nGo,Medium\nTypeScript,Medium')
    ✔️ Sucessfull, result: {'status': 'success', 'filename': 'language.csv'}
2: 🌟: Ran create_file, result: {'status': 'success', 'filename': 'language.csv'}
    📝 Calling LLM
3: 🤖: I have created a file called `language.csv` with the information of the top 10 most popular programming languages and their complexity.
```

4. Final output can be accessed via `result.output`
```
{'status': 'success', 'filename': 'language.csv'}
```
