This library aims to help you develop function calling capabilities for your functions and build applications that utilizes function calling.

## What is function calling?
LLM function calling is the ability to describe functions to LLMs and have the LLMs infer the input of the functions based off natural language query. 

For example:
- “Email Anya to see if she wants to get coffee next Friday” ->
```python
send_email(to="anya@gmail.com", body="Hey Anya, do you want to get coffee this Friday? Let me know what time works best for you" )
```
- “Who are our highest spending customers” ->
```python
sql_query(query="SELECT customer, spend FROM CUSTOMERS ORDERED BY spend DESC;")
```


## Setting up
Install with `pip install argai`

## Quickstart

Make your functions intelligent and queryable via natural language:
```python
def create_file(filename, text):
    with open(filename,'w') as f:
        f.write(text)
        return {"status" : "success", "filename" : filename}

from argai import ArgFunction

af = ArgFunction(create_file)

result = af.func_call("Create a file called language.csv with all the programming languages available.")
```
